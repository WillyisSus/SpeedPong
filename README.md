HI, I'm Willy and Speed Pong is my very first game. 
Speed Pong is obviously inspired by Pong.
I make it as a minigame for a big one at first so a litle bit of speed is addded to the game to accelerate its tempo.
But I find it fun to play with friends if you want something fast and easy to get a hang of.
So enjoy it, though some bugs and glitches maybe still in presence (Hope I can find and fix them OwO).
Thank for playing this game, I appreciate that.
